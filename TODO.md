# TODO List

- ~~Make central node an AP~~, DONE
- ~~Allow central node to control NXT motor via wired or Bluetooth~~, DONE over USB
- ~~Make arm node an AP, while bridging the connection to central node over a different wireless interface~~, DONE, creates new network for devices connected over arm, proxying possible but currently not implemented
- ~~Make arm node signal metric accessible to central node over SSH or API or something `iw wlan1 station dump`~~, DONE, node can be accessed from parent network, need to implement a server for this info
- Have code to rotate arm 90 degrees forward and backwards, signaled by USB
- Have some way to initiate the arm movement based on the signal metric
- Program the arm movement based on the signal (client needs to keep pinging the AP)
- Automatically run the arm movement based on feedback or intervals
