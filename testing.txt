Findings: in every case, the arm got physically closest to the client, yet in some cases, did not recieve a performance increase. Would be much more beneficial in 60 Ghz networks (interference-sensitive). Throughput much higher when arm node transmits and client responds, client devices not optimized for transmitting?
